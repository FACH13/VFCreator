You can create spline based vector fields in Unreal.
You can use more than one spline and change the properties of the field vectors along the length of the spline.
You can save the field to disk and use field in other programs.

Features: You can set number of grids, their size, pivot offset of field. You can combine result from splines by actions, such as: additive, subtractive, multiply, avarage, min or max vector's length. Change the properties of the field vectors along the length of the spline with float curves. Add random direction. Normalize summary result.
